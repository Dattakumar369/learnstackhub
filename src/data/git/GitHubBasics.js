# GitHub Basics - Remote Repositories

GitHub is like a cloud storage for your code. It hosts your Git repositories online so you can:
- Backup your code
- Share it with others
- Collaborate on projects
- Showcase your work

Think of it as **Git** (the tool) + **GitHub** (the platform).

---

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories. It's the most popular platform for:
- Open source projects
- Code collaboration
- Portfolio showcase
- Team development

**Key Features:**
- Free public repositories
- Private repositories (free for individuals)
- Issue tracking
- Pull requests
- Code reviews
- GitHub Pages (host websites)

---

## Creating a GitHub Account

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter your email, password, and username
4. Verify your email
5. Complete the setup

**Choose a good username:**
- Professional (for work)
- Memorable
- Not too long
- Available (GitHub will check)

---

## Creating Your First Repository

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right
2. Select **"New repository"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: \`my-java-project\`
   - **Description**: "My first Java project with Git"
   - **Visibility**: Public or Private
   - **Initialize**: Don't check "Add a README" (we'll push existing code)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

GitHub will show you the repository URL. It looks like:
\`\`\`
https://github.com/yourusername/my-java-project.git
\`\`\`

Copy this URL - you'll need it!

---

## Connecting Local Repository to GitHub

Now let's connect your local Git repository to GitHub:

### Step 1: Add Remote

In your local project folder:

\`\`\`bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-java-project.git
\`\`\`

**Verify it was added:**
\`\`\`bash
git remote -v
\`\`\`

**Output:**
\`\`\`
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/my-java-project.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/my-java-project.git (push)
\`\`\`

\`origin\` is the default name for your remote repository.

---

## Pushing to GitHub

Now let's upload your code to GitHub:

### Step 1: Make Sure You Have Commits

\`\`\`bash
git log --oneline
\`\`\`

You should see at least one commit.

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

\`\`\`bash
git push -u origin main
\`\`\`

**What this does:**
- \`push\`: Upload your commits
- \`-u\`: Set upstream (so future pushes are easier)
- \`origin\`: The remote repository
- \`main\`: The branch to push

**First time?** GitHub will ask for authentication:
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password)

---

## Creating a Personal Access Token

GitHub requires tokens for authentication:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings
2. Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
3. Click "Generate new token"
4. Give it a name: "My Computer"
5. Select scopes: Check **"repo"** (full control)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

**Use this token as your password when pushing.**

---

## After First Push

Refresh your GitHub repository page. You should see:
- Your files
- Commit history
- Branch information

Your code is now on GitHub! 🎉

---

## Pulling from GitHub

To download changes from GitHub:

\`\`\`bash
git pull origin main
\`\`\`

This downloads and merges changes from GitHub into your local repository.

---

## Making Changes and Pushing

### Workflow:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Make changes to your code
# ... edit files ...

# 2. Check what changed
git status

# 3. Stage changes
git add .

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push
\`\`\`

After the first push with \`-u\`, you can just use \`git push\`!

---

## Cloning a Repository

To get a copy of someone else's repository (or your own on another computer):

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
\`\`\`

This:
- Downloads the repository
- Creates a local copy
- Sets up the remote automatically

**Example:**
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/Dattakumar369/learnstackhub.git
cd learnstackhub
\`\`\`

---

## Viewing Remote Information

**See all remotes:**
\`\`\`bash
git remote -v
\`\`\`

**See remote URL:**
\`\`\`bash
git remote get-url origin
\`\`\`

**Change remote URL:**
\`\`\`bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/newusername/newrepo.git
\`\`\`

---

## Real-World Example

Let's say you're working on a Java project:

\`\`\`bash
# Day 1: Create local project
mkdir ecommerce-app
cd ecommerce-app
git init
echo 'public class App { }' > App.java
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"

# Create GitHub repository (on website)
# Then connect:
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-app.git
git push -u origin main

# Day 2: Work on feature
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add product catalog"
git push

# Day 3: Work on another computer
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-app.git
cd ecommerce-app
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add shopping cart"
git push
\`\`\`

---

## Common GitHub Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| \`git remote add origin <url>\` | Connect to GitHub |
| \`git push -u origin main\` | First push |
| \`git push\` | Push changes |
| \`git pull\` | Download changes |
| \`git clone <url>\` | Copy repository |
| \`git remote -v\` | View remotes |
| \`git fetch\` | Download without merging |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Push regularly**: Don't lose work - push often
2. **Pull before push**: Get latest changes first
3. **Write good commits**: Clear messages help everyone
4. **Use branches**: Don't push directly to main
5. **Keep tokens safe**: Don't share your access token

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Use Personal Access Token, not password
- Check token has "repo" scope

### "Repository not found"
- Check repository name is correct
- Verify you have access

### "Updates were rejected"
- Someone else pushed changes
- Pull first: \`git pull\`, then push

---
