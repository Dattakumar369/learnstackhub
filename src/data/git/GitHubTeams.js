## Organizing Teams

### By Role

**Example structure:**
- **Backend Team:** Java developers
- **Frontend Team:** React developers
- **DevOps Team:** Infrastructure
- **QA Team:** Testers
- **Design Team:** UI/UX designers

- **API Team:** API development

### By Feature

**Example structure:**
- **Authentication Team:** Login/security features
- **Payment Team:** Payment processing
- **Search Team:** Search functionality

## Nested Teams (Parent-Child)

Organize teams hierarchically:

**Example:**
\`\`\`
Engineering (Parent)
├── Backend Team (Child)
│   ├── Java Team
│   └── Node.js Team
├── Frontend Team (Child)
│   ├── React Team
│   └── Vue Team
└── DevOps Team (Child)
\`\`\`

### Creating Nested Teams

1. Create parent team (e.g., "Engineering")
2. Create child team (e.g., "Backend Team")
3. Go to child team → **Settings**
4. Under **Parent team**, select parent team
5. Click **Save**

**Benefits:**
- Child teams inherit parent permissions
- Easier to manage large organizations
- Clear hierarchy

## Team Notifications

### Managing Team Notifications

1. Go to team page
2. Click **Settings**
3. Configure notifications:
   - **Team mentions:** When team is @mentioned
   - **Team discussions:** New discussions
   - **Repository activity:** Team repository updates

## Real-World Example

### Java Development Team Structure

**Organization:** TechCorp

**Teams:**
\`\`\`
Engineering (Parent)
├── Backend Team
│   ├── Java Developers
│   └── Database Team
├── Frontend Team
└── DevOps Team

Product (Parent)
├── Product Managers
└── Designers

QA (Parent)
├── Manual Testers
└── Automation Testers
\`\`\`

**Repository Access:**
- **ecommerce-backend:** Backend Team (Write), QA Team (Read)
- **ecommerce-frontend:** Frontend Team (Write), QA Team (Read)
- **ecommerce-api:** Backend Team (Write), Frontend Team (Read)

**Workflow:**
1. Backend developer creates feature branch
2. Creates pull request
3. Requests review from @backend-team
4. Backend team reviews
5. QA team tests
6. Merged to main

## Best Practices

1. **Organize by function:**
   - Group people by what they do
   - Clear team names
   - Logical structure

2. **Use nested teams:**
   - For large organizations
   - Clear hierarchy
