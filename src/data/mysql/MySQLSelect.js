# SELECT Query — Retrieving Data from Database

The SELECT statement is the most frequently used SQL command. It retrieves data from one or more tables. Mastering SELECT is essential for working with databases.

---

## Basic SELECT Syntax

\`\`\`sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
\`\`\`

---

## Simple Examples

### Select All Columns

\`\`\`sql
-- Select all columns from users table
SELECT * FROM users;
\`\`\`

### Select Specific Columns

\`\`\`sql
-- Select only name and email
SELECT name, email FROM users;
\`\`\`

### Select with WHERE Clause

\`\`\`sql
-- Select users where age is greater than 25
SELECT name, email, age 
FROM users 
WHERE age > 25;
\`\`\`

---

## WHERE Clause

Filters rows based on conditions.

### Comparison Operators

\`\`\`sql
-- Equal to
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 25;

-- Not equal to
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age != 25;
-- Or
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age <> 25;

-- Greater than
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 100;

-- Less than
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 50;

-- Greater than or equal
SELECT * FROM products WHERE stock >= 10;

-- Less than or equal
SELECT * FROM products WHERE stock <= 5;
\`\`\`

### Logical Operators

\`\`\`sql
-- AND - Both conditions must be true
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE age > 25 AND city = 'New York';

-- OR - Either condition can be true
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE city = 'New York' OR city = 'Los Angeles';

-- NOT - Negates condition
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE NOT city = 'New York';
\`\`\`

### IN Operator

\`\`\`sql
-- Select users in specific cities
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE city IN ('New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago');

-- Select products with specific IDs
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE id IN (1, 5, 10, 15);
\`\`\`

### LIKE Operator (Pattern Matching)

\`\`\`sql
-- Starts with 'John'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'John%';

-- Ends with 'com'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';

-- Contains 'admin'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%admin%';

-- Single character wildcard
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE 'J_n';  -- Matches: Jan, Jon, etc.
\`\`\`

### BETWEEN Operator

\`\`\`sql
-- Select products with price between 50 and 100
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 100;

-- Select users with age between 25 and 35
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 35;
\`\`\`

### IS NULL / IS NOT NULL

\`\`\`sql
-- Select users without phone number
SELECT * FROM users WHERE phone IS NULL;

-- Select users with phone number
SELECT * FROM users WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
\`\`\`

---

## ORDER BY

Sorts results.

\`\`\`sql
-- Sort by name (ascending)
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name;

-- Sort by name (descending)
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY name DESC;

-- Sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY city, name;

-- Sort by age descending, then name ascending
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY age DESC, name ASC;
\`\`\`

---

## LIMIT

Limits number of results.

\`\`\`sql
-- Get first 10 users
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;

-- Get 10 users starting from 20th (pagination)
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 20, 10;
-- Or
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
\`\`\`

---

## DISTINCT

Removes duplicate rows.

\`\`\`sql
-- Get unique cities
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM users;

-- Get unique combinations
SELECT DISTINCT city, country FROM users;
\`\`\`

---

## Aliases

Give columns or tables temporary names.

\`\`\`sql
-- Column alias
SELECT name AS user_name, email AS user_email FROM users;

-- Table alias
SELECT u.name, u.email 
FROM users AS u 
WHERE u.age > 25;
\`\`\`

---

## Aggregate Functions

### COUNT

\`\`\`sql
-- Count all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

-- Count non-null values
SELECT COUNT(email) FROM users;

-- Count with condition
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE age > 25;
\`\`\`

### SUM

\`\`\`sql
-- Sum of all prices
SELECT SUM(price) FROM products;

-- Sum with condition
SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed';
\`\`\`

### AVG

\`\`\`sql
-- Average age
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;

-- Average price
SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;
\`\`\`

### MIN and MAX

\`\`\`sql
-- Minimum price
SELECT MIN(price) FROM products;

-- Maximum age
SELECT MAX(age) FROM users;

-- Get product with minimum price
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) FROM products);
\`\`\`

---

## GROUP BY

Groups rows with same values.

\`\`\`sql
-- Count users by city
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS user_count 
FROM users 
GROUP BY city;

-- Average price by category
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM products 
GROUP BY category;

-- Total sales by customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;
\`\`\`

---

## HAVING

Filters groups (used with GROUP BY).

\`\`\`sql
-- Cities with more than 10 users
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS user_count 
FROM users 
GROUP BY city 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

-- Categories with average price > 100
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM products 
GROUP BY category 
HAVING AVG(price) > 100;
\`\`\`

**Difference:**
- **WHERE** - Filters rows before grouping
- **HAVING** - Filters groups after grouping

## Complete Real-World Examples

### E-Commerce Queries

\`\`\`sql
-- Get all active products sorted by price
SELECT id, name, price, stock 
FROM products 
WHERE is_active = 1 
ORDER BY price ASC;

-- Get top 10 best-selling products
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold 
FROM order_items 
GROUP BY product_id 
ORDER BY total_sold DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Get customers who spent more than $1000
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id 
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 1000 
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- Get products with low stock
SELECT name, stock 
FROM products 
WHERE stock < 10 
ORDER BY stock ASC;

-- Search products by name
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE name LIKE '%laptop%' 
AND price BETWEEN 500 AND 1500 
ORDER BY price;
\`\`\`

---

## Combining Clauses

Complete SELECT syntax order:

\`\`\`sql
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column1 ASC/DESC
LIMIT number;
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS product_count,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price,
    MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM products
WHERE is_active = 1
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY avg_price DESC
LIMIT 10;
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### 1. Select Only Needed Columns
\`\`\`sql
-- Good
SELECT name, email FROM users;

-- Bad (unless you need all)
SELECT * FROM users;
\`\`\`

### 2. Use WHERE to Filter Early
\`\`\`sql
-- Good - filters before processing
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25;

-- Bad - processes all then filters
SELECT * FROM users;
-- Then filter in application
\`\`\`

### 3. Use Indexes
\`\`\`sql
-- Create index for frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_age ON users(age);
\`\`\`

### 4. Use LIMIT for Large Results
\`\`\`sql
-- Good - limits results
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 100;

-- Bad - might return millions of rows
SELECT * FROM products;
\`\`\`

## Summary

SELECT is the foundation of data retrieval:
- **Basic SELECT** - Get data from tables
- **WHERE** - Filter rows
- **ORDER BY** - Sort results
- **LIMIT** - Restrict results
- **GROUP BY** - Group data
- **HAVING** - Filter groups
- **Aggregate Functions** - Calculate statistics

Master SELECT, and you can retrieve any data from your database!

## Practice Question

**Q:** Write a query to find the top 5 customers (by total order amount) who have placed orders in the last 30 days, showing their name, email, and total spent.

**Answer:**
\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
    c.name,
    c.email,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
