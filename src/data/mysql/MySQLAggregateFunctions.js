# MySQL Aggregate Functions — Analyzing Data

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value. They're essential for data analysis and reporting.

---

## What are Aggregate Functions?

Aggregate functions operate on multiple rows and return a single result:
- **COUNT** - Count rows
- **SUM** - Sum of values
- **AVG** - Average of values
- **MIN** - Minimum value
- **MAX** - Maximum value
- **GROUP_CONCAT** - Concatenate values

---

## 1. COUNT()

Counts the number of rows.

### Basic COUNT

\`\`\`sql
-- Count all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

-- Count non-NULL values
SELECT COUNT(email) FROM users;

-- Count with condition
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE age > 25;
\`\`\`

### COUNT with DISTINCT

\`\`\`sql
-- Count unique cities
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city) FROM users;

-- Count unique customers who placed orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM orders;
\`\`\`

---

## 2. SUM()

Calculates the sum of numeric values.

\`\`\`sql
-- Sum of all prices
SELECT SUM(price) FROM products;

-- Sum with condition
SELECT SUM(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed';

-- Sum with calculation
SELECT SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue FROM order_items;
\`\`\`

---

## 3. AVG()

Calculates the average of numeric values.

\`\`\`sql
-- Average age
SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;

-- Average price
SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;

-- Average with condition
SELECT AVG(total_amount) FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed';
\`\`\`

---

## 4. MIN() and MAX()

Find minimum and maximum values.

\`\`\`sql
-- Minimum price
SELECT MIN(price) FROM products;

-- Maximum age
SELECT MAX(age) FROM users;

-- Get product with minimum price
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) FROM products);

-- Get product with maximum price
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products);
\`\`\`

---

## 5. GROUP_CONCAT()

Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string.

\`\`\`sql
-- List all product names in a category
SELECT 
    category,
    GROUP_CONCAT(name) AS products
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- With separator
SELECT 
    category,
    GROUP_CONCAT(name SEPARATOR ', ') AS products
FROM products
GROUP BY category;

-- With ordering
SELECT 
    category,
    GROUP_CONCAT(name ORDER BY price DESC SEPARATOR ', ') AS products
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
\`\`\`

---

## GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions

Group rows and apply aggregate functions to each group.

### Basic GROUP BY

\`\`\`sql
-- Count users by city
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS user_count 
FROM users 
GROUP BY city;

-- Average price by category
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM products 
GROUP BY category;

-- Total sales by customer
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id;
\`\`\`

### Multiple Column GROUP BY

\`\`\`sql
-- Count orders by customer and status
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    status,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id, status;
\`\`\`

---

## HAVING Clause

Filters groups after GROUP BY (similar to WHERE but for groups).

\`\`\`sql
-- Cities with more than 10 users
SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS user_count 
FROM users 
GROUP BY city 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

-- Categories with average price > 100
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM products 
GROUP BY category 
HAVING AVG(price) > 100;

-- Customers who spent more than $1000
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent 
FROM orders 
GROUP BY customer_id 
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 1000;
\`\`\`

**WHERE vs HAVING:**
- **WHERE** - Filters rows before grouping
- **HAVING** - Filters groups after grouping

---

## Multiple Aggregate Functions

Use multiple aggregate functions in one query.

\`\`\`sql
-- Product statistics
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS product_count,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price,
    MIN(price) AS min_price,
    MAX(price) AS max_price,
    SUM(stock) AS total_stock
FROM products
GROUP BY category;
\`\`\`

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Sales Report

\`\`\`sql
-- Monthly sales report
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count,
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue,
    AVG(total_amount) AS avg_order_value,
    MIN(total_amount) AS min_order,
    MAX(total_amount) AS max_order
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC;
\`\`\`

### Example 2: Customer Analytics

\`\`\`sql
-- Customer purchase statistics
SELECT 
    c.name AS customer_name,
    COUNT(o.id) AS order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent,
    AVG(o.total_amount) AS avg_order_value,
    MIN(o.order_date) AS first_order,
    MAX(o.order_date) AS last_order
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name
HAVING COUNT(o.id) > 0
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
\`\`\`

### Example 3: Product Performance

\`\`\`sql
-- Product sales analysis
SELECT 
    p.name AS product_name,
    p.category,
    COUNT(oi.id) AS times_ordered,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS total_revenue,
    AVG(oi.price) AS avg_selling_price
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id AND o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
\`\`\`

### Example 4: Category Analysis

\`\`\`sql
-- Category statistics
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) AS product_count,
    SUM(stock) AS total_stock,
    AVG(price) AS avg_price,
    MIN(price) AS cheapest,
    MAX(price) AS most_expensive,
    SUM(price * stock) AS inventory_value
FROM products
WHERE is_active = 1
GROUP BY category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
ORDER BY inventory_value DESC;
\`\`\`

---

## Aggregate Functions with JOINs

\`\`\`sql
-- Total revenue by customer with customer details
SELECT 
    c.name AS customer_name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(o.id) AS order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_revenue,
    AVG(o.total_amount) AS avg_order_value
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
\`\`\`

---

## Conditional Aggregation

Use CASE with aggregate functions.

\`\`\`sql
-- Count by status
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS completed_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS pending_orders,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'cancelled' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cancelled_orders
FROM orders;

-- Revenue by status
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) AS completed_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN total_amount ELSE 0 END) AS pending_revenue
FROM orders;
\`\`\`

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions
\`\`\`sql
-- Good
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY category;

-- Bad (won't work as expected)
SELECT category, COUNT(*) FROM products;
\`\`\`

### 2. Include All Non-Aggregate Columns in GROUP BY
\`\`\`sql
-- Good
SELECT category, name, COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY category, name;

-- Bad (MySQL 5.7+ strict mode will error)
SELECT category, name, COUNT(*) FROM products GROUP BY category;
\`\`\`

### 3. Use HAVING for Group Filters
\`\`\`sql
-- Good
SELECT category, AVG(price) FROM products GROUP BY category HAVING AVG(price) > 100;

-- Less efficient
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM products GROUP BY category
) AS subquery WHERE avg_price > 100;
\`\`\`

## Summary

**Aggregate Functions:**
- **COUNT()** - Count rows
- **SUM()** - Sum values
- **AVG()** - Average values
- **MIN()** - Minimum value
- **MAX()** - Maximum value
- **GROUP_CONCAT()** - Concatenate values

**Key Concepts:**
- Use with **GROUP BY** for grouped analysis
- Use **HAVING** to filter groups

## Practice Question

**Q:** Write a query to find the top 3 product categories by total revenue, showing category name, number of products, total quantity sold, and total revenue. Only include categories with at least 10 products sold.

**Answer:**
\`\`\`sql
SELECT 
    p.category,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) AS product_count,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS total_revenue
FROM products p
INNER JOIN order_items oi ON p.id = oi.product_id
INNER JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id AND o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY p.category
HAVING SUM(oi.quantity) >= 10
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
